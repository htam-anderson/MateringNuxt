| d       | Problem 1 - Scripts and Single Page Apps | - The problem happen with those 3rd party library doesn't support SPA natively<br>- In our case, it's google map library we added in the scripts<br>- For the property page by its own its work fine, but when we go back to home page and click another property it will show error<br>- The resone behind this is, for some library they will load another inner library they need to be operated normally<br>- So the nuxt cache will let us know that there are an things that load once again in page<br>- Then we remember the `callback=initMap` in the query parameters of google map api earlier, to do that we need to have a function `initMap`<br>- We try to use window object in client side to set the page is load but it will come to another issue is `initMap not found` then we try to solve it like the comment in source code<br>- Concept of skip in `head()`                                                                                                                                                                                                    | *NOTE:* PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN USING 3RD PARTY LIBRARY, SCINE WE WILL FACING THIS ISSUE                                                                                                                               |
| e       | Problem 2 - Network Latency              | - For modern network speed, so far so good for this app, but things is not perfect in case of some where have 56kbs speed of internet => facing network latency problem<br>- The problem is with the low speed internet, the page will be load very slow, we can try it with the software called [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/)<br>- The reason behind this is we using defer attribute when loading google library, the nuxt application source is load at the end of the page, so it have to wait for the google library load and executing first<br>- So we will change it to async<br>- But when it async, then the page is running very fast, lead to the source that using google library in `mounted()` cannot executed since the library not finish loading and executing yet<br>- We will create a method called `showMap()` and move the code from `mounted()` to `methods`<br>- To be invoke `showMap()` we need to use `setInterval()` in `mounted()`<br>- Now the google library can be loaded and finished executing anytime except infect the whole page |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| f       | Solution - Plugins To The Rescue         | - Scine we have a bunch of code just for hanling showing google map on our page, we need the place to put all of that code to make the component source look nice and clean, that where plugin came for the rescure<br>- Create a plugins foleder, under that the file name have convention for nuxt to support us:<br>+ File name contain .client.js : Will let nuxt only run in browser<br>+ File name contain .server.js : Will let nuxt only run in server<br>+ File name contain .neither.js : Will let nuxt run in both<br>- Now we will migrate peace by peace to the plugin file we created `maps.client.js`<br>- After folow the process of creating plugin we will need to add the plugin to `nuxt.config.js` and call the function `showMap()` from plugin in `mounted()`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | *NOTE:* USING `maps` AS A PLUGIN NAME INSTEAD OF `googleMaps` BECAUSE OF WITH THE GENERIC NAME, WE DON'T NEED TO MODIFY ANYTHING ELSE BESIDE THE PLUGIN CODE IF WE CHANGE TO USE ANOTHER THING RATHER THAN GOOGLE MAP |

| c       | Fetch & Polyfills               | - In case of the older browser not support fetch, we need to using another thing to handle it<br>- In this case there are 3 options: <br>+ [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch)<br>+ [unfetch](https://github.com/developit/unfetch)<br>+ [Polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/)                                                                                                                                                                                | - We can skip it for now and comeback to it later if need                                                                                                                 |
| d       | Handling Errors                 | - In case of user modify the URL for not found records or the API die, we need to handle the error response from the API<br>- By itself, Nuxt already gave us the `error` function to handle the default error page, we can use it in `async asyncData({ params, $dataApi, error }) {`<br>- Fetch response already have a property `ok` to check whether the response with http code 200 or not<br>- Adapt it with the `error` from Nuxt we can have the simple error handling | - This is the started error handler method                                                                                                                                |
| e       | Customizing The Error Page      | - Of course, the default error page of Nuxt not really look friendly, so we need to customize the error page                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | - For professional and helpful 404 page, we can refer to [Google's 404 Page Recommendations](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/soft-404-errors) |
